## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes delivery of customer value, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement. The lifecycle starts with a well-defined initiation phase, where project ideas are validated through business need assessment, stakeholder alignment, and creation of a Project One-pager. This is followed by detailed planning, during which work is broken down into manageable increments, dependencies and risks are identified, and a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria is established. All project activities and artifacts—including roadmaps, risk registers, and retrospective notes—are transparently documented and regularly updated in the repository, ensuring that processes remain visible and accessible to all team members.

The core workflows revolve around tight coordination and clarity of roles. Project Managers (PMs) oversee scheduling, risk management, and stakeholder communications, while Product Managers shape the product vision, set priorities, and define measurable outcomes. Developers focus on building and testing features to specified acceptance criteria, contributing to design reviews and documentation. Throughout the lifecycle, responsibilities remain clear: PMs facilitate meetings and manage plans, PdMs handle backlog prioritization and validation, and Developers deliver on technical commitments. This delineation enables efficient project execution, minimizes ambiguity, and accelerates decision-making.

Communication is central to OctoAcme's approach, with established cadences ensuring that information flows effectively among all stakeholders. The team holds daily standups to address progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for broader updates and risk escalation, and regular demos or reviews at the end of each sprint. Additionally, weekly PM and PdM syncs align delivery and product vision, while monthly stakeholder updates maintain organizational transparency. Status reporting is standardized with templates, and escalation paths for both general and security-related incidents are clearly documented, promoting swift resolution of challenges.

Quality assurance is woven into every stage of execution. Each pull request must reference an issue and satisfy its acceptance criteria, and automated tests as well as linting are run in continuous integration pipelines before review. The team employs a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke testing, with security scanning also mandated in CI. Manual QA and risk tracking complement these practices, with metrics like velocity and burndown used to monitor progress. Regular retrospectives are held to capture learnings and drive continuous improvement, with actionable items added to the project backlog and tracked through to completion. This holistic, process-driven approach ensures that OctoAcme delivers reliable, high-quality products while maintaining agility and responsiveness to change.
