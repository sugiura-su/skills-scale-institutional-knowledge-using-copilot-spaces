# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Include cross-functional team: Developers, PM, Product Manager, UX Designer, Technical Writer, DevOps Engineer, Support Lead, Data Analyst
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure all roles have opportunity to share perspective

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items (Data Analyst tracks metrics)
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Gather feedback from all roles (UX Designer for user research, Support Lead for customer issues, DevOps Engineer for reliability, Technical Writer for documentation quality)
- Review collaboration effectiveness (see [Cross-Functional Collaboration Guide](octoacme-cross-functional-collaboration.md))
