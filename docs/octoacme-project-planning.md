# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (includes UX Designer, Technical Writer, DevOps Engineer, Support Lead, Data Analyst)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager, with input from UX Designer on user flows)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) (Developers, DevOps Engineer for infrastructure work)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) (includes documentation completeness, accessibility checks, monitoring setup)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (cross-functional team including DevOps for infrastructure, Support for customer impact)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (PM, with input from Support Lead for customer communication timing)
7. Define success metrics and measurement strategy (Data Analyst, Product Manager)
